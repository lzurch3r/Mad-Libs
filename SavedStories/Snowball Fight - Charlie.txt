The Snowball fight

  Charlie was ready for the largest and finest snowball fight of
his life. All the children in the neighborhood have been planning this sassy
showdown for 117 and 3 days. In order to win this snowball fight, Charlie
had to make some wonderful baby or else he was sure to lose. Before he
could do that he needed a snack, so he grabbed some beans and ricotta cheese and got to
work.
  Charlie went out intot he snow and started constructing
thicc snowballs. He had to watch out for the chartreuse snow
because that was contaminated by toucans, and you know what that means...
He then hid these snowballs under a wateria in the front yard to keep them
safe. The fight was about to start, but he wanted to take it to the next level. So, he
climbed the diarrhea in the front yard and hid while holding a bunch of
snowballs.
  When the battle began, Charlie started farting the snowballs
everywhere he could. One snowball hit a dump truck while another hit an
innocent boulder. He was dominating the battle until Harry Potter threw
a snowball right at his belly button, which knocked him to the ground.
Unfortunately, Charlie fell right into the chartreuse snow...
