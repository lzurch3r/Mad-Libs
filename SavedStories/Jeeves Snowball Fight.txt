Jeeves was ready for the largest and wackiest snowball fight of
his life. All the children in the neighborhood have been planning this blue
showdown for 1923 days. In order to win this snowball fight, Jeeves
had to make some wonderful Splinter or else he was sure to lose. Before he
could do that he needed a snack, so he grabbed some Lunchables and got to
work.
  Jeeves went out intot he snow and started constructing
sticky snowballs. He had to watch out for the purple snow
because that was contaminated by penguins, and you know what that means...
He then hid these snowballs under a truck in the front yard to keep them
safe. The fight was about to start, but he wanted to take it to the next level. So, he
climbed the porcupine in the front yard and hid while holding a bunch of
snowballs.
  When the battle began, Jeeves started swingin the snowballs
everywhere he could. One snowball hit a portend while another hit an
innocent white cat. He was dominating the battle until Legolas threw
a snowball right at his pointed nose, which knocked him to the ground.
Unfortunately, Jeeves fell right into the purple snow...
