# Overview

This program helped me to learn Java. Because of my familiarity with C++,
I imagined that Java would prove to be a decent challenge to understand and
pull through. 

This is a Mad Libs program that prompts the user to enter a variety of
different words that combine to tell a story based on a template(s).
Due to the nature of Mad Libs, each story becomes unique and personalized to
the user.

Learning to do Mad Libs this way taught me more about Java and text manipulation.
It also proved a good exercise in learning to read and write to files.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

- Create a more robust user interface that implements a menu system.
  The system would use numbers to guide the user toward options.
- Check for more possible bugs, but allow for more freedom of user input.
- Implement a way to delete files from a filename typed by the user.
- Figure out how to close the input stream without bugging the program.
